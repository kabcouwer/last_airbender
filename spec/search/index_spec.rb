# And I should see a list with the detailed information for the first 25 members of the Fire Nation.

# And for each of the members I should see:
# - The name of the member (and their photo, if they have one)
# - The list of allies or "None"
# - The list of enemies or "None"
# - Any affiliations that the member has
